# Uploading data locally in Svelte using HTML input tag
This repository contains a template on how to upload (csv-)data from a local folder into a Svelte app.
The file is read using [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader), and parsed as a csv file using the csvParse from the D3 library.
